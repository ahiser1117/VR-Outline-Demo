# VR-Outline-Demo
A demo of the Quick Outline package and its use with VR pointers

The 5 types of outlines are included on 5 objects. Depending on the outline type different parts of the object are outlined/silhouetted.

Each controller has the pointer.cs component and each object has the highlightable.cs component.

The main behavior is seen in the pointer.cs script.
